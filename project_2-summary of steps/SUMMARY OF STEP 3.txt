SUMMARY OF STEP 3

3.1 SEGMENTATION VARIABLES:-
 The passage discusses segmentation variables and their role in market segmentation analysis, distinguishing between commonsense and data-driven approaches.

In commonsense segmentation, a single characteristic, such as gender, is used as the segmentation variable to split the sample into segments. Descriptor variables, like age and preferences, are then used to describe these segments in detail.

In contrast, data-driven segmentation utilizes multiple variables to identify naturally existing or artificially created segments based on shared characteristics. Descriptor variables are still used to provide detailed descriptions of segments.

The quality of empirical data is crucial for both approaches. In commonsense segmentation, it ensures accurate assignment of individuals to segments and proper description of segments. Similarly, in data-driven segmentation, data quality determines the quality of the resulting segments and their descriptions.

Empirical data for segmentation studies can come from various sources, including surveys, observations (such as scanner data), and experimental studies. It's essential to choose data sources that accurately reflect consumer behavior, rather than relying solely on surveys, which may not always capture behavior accurately.

Overall, good market segmentation analysis requires high-quality empirical data, regardless of the segmentation approach used.

3.2 SEGMENTATION CRITERIA:-
The passage discusses various segmentation criteria used in market segmentation, including geographic, socio-demographic, psychographic, and behavioral criteria.

Geographic Segmentation: This involves dividing the market based on the consumer's location of residence. While simple, it's effective, especially when language or cultural differences exist between regions. However, it may not capture other relevant characteristics beyond location.

Socio-Demographic Segmentation: This includes factors like age, gender, income, and education. While easy to determine, socio-demographic factors may not always explain consumer behavior well. They may be useful in industries where certain products are associated with specific demographics, like luxury goods or baby products.

Psychographic Segmentation: This approach groups consumers based on psychological criteria like beliefs, interests, preferences, and benefits sought. It provides insights into underlying reasons for consumer behavior but is more complex and requires reliable measures.

Behavioral Segmentation: This involves grouping consumers based on their behavior or reported behavior, such as purchase frequency, spending amount, or brand choice. It's advantageous because it directly uses the behavior of interest as the basis for segmentation, but obtaining behavioral data may be challenging.

Each segmentation criterion has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice depends on factors like the nature of the market, the product or service being offered, and the available data. Overall, the goal is to choose the simplest and most effective approach that aligns with the organization's objectives.

3.3 DATA FROM SURVEY STUDIES:-
The section discusses key considerations when using survey data for market segmentation analysis. Here are the main points:

Choice of Variables: Carefully selecting segmentation variables is crucial. Including unnecessary variables can lead to respondent fatigue, increase the complexity of segmentation analysis, and distract algorithms from identifying the correct segments.

Response Options: The response options provided to respondents determine the scale of the data for analysis. Binary or metric response options are preferred for segmentation analysis as they avoid complications with distance measures. Ordinal data, while common, can pose challenges in analysis.

Response Styles: Survey data is prone to capturing biases, including response styles like extreme responses or agreement with all statements. Response styles can impact segmentation results and need to be minimized or corrected for in analysis.

Sample Size: Sufficient sample size is critical for accurate segmentation analysis. Studies recommend a sample size of at least 100 respondents per segmentation variable to ensure reliable results. Increasing sample size improves the correctness of segment extraction, particularly for smaller samples.

Overall, high-quality survey data containing necessary variables, free from biases and response styles, and with a sufficient sample size, is essential for effective market segmentation analysis.

3.4,3.5 AND 3.6:-
Internal Data: Organizations can use internal data like scanner data from stores or online purchase data for segmentation. It reflects actual behavior but may be biased towards existing customers.

Experimental Data: Data from experiments, such as consumer response to ads or choice experiments, can also be used. They provide insights into consumer preferences and behavior.

Step 3 Checklist:

Convene a team: Discuss segmentation variables and data collection.
Identify variables: Decide on segmentation and descriptor variables.
Plan data collection: Develop strategies to collect valid data.
Design data collection: Ensure methods minimize biases and errors.
Collect data: Execute the plan and gather necessary information.
